# global_planner_tester
A tool to test a global planner plugin. You can simply publish a topic named /map containing a static map to build a scene for the planner. Use the rviz tool "Publish Point" to set the start and goal points. The plan will be made and displayed. You can set up the planner using yaml file just like the way you use move_base.
